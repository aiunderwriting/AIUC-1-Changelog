# AIUC-1-Changelog

Changelog for the AIUC-1 standard

## How to Use This Changelog

This repository tracks changes to our controls and requirements over time. Each update is saved as a "commit" with a descriptive title and timestamp.

### Understanding the Commit List

When you [view](https://github.com/aiunderwriting/AIUC-1-Changelog/commits/main/) the commit history, you'll see:

- **Commit title**: A brief description of what changed (e.g., "January controls and requirements")
- **Author & timestamp**: Who made the change and when
- **Commit ID**: A unique code (e.g., `3f3ad18`) that identifies this specific version

### Viewing Changes

To see what changed in a specific update:

**Click on the commit title** you're interested in:

You'll see a detailed view showing:
1. Lines in **green** with a `+` = content that was added
2. Lines in **red** with a `-` = content that was removed
3. Unchanged lines appear in white/grey
